# Diffuser

## Overview

The Diffusers library simplifies the process of image synthesis and transformation using pretrained models. This readme provides clear instructions and examples for utilizing the library's pipelines, enabling users to effortlessly generate images, transform existing ones, and synthesize images from text prompts.

## Pipelines

### 1. Image Generation with DDPM Models

Easily generate images using pretrained DDPM models. The example below demonstrates generating an image with a cat using the DDPM pipeline.

### 2. Text-to-Image Synthesis

Create visually captivating images from textual prompts with the text-to-image pipeline. The following example generates an image based on the prompt "A peaceful mountain landscape at sunrise."

### 3. Image-to-Image Transformation

Transform existing images using pretrained models with the image-to-image pipeline. The example showcases transforming an image by adding a vintage filter.
